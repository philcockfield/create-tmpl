Succinct, composable, template stamper...ðŸ¤–...ðŸ¤–...ðŸ¤–

### Introduction
Take a directory, or compose multiple files and directories, into a template that can be copied to the file-system or memory.  Add simple transformers to the pipeline to precisely customize each file, or conditionally filter the file out, before it is written based on programmatic variables (via the [API](#API)), or values entered by the user into the command-line (via the [CLI](#CLI)).
